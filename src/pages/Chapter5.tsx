          <p className="mb-4">In The Philippines a Century Hence, Rizal questioned whether Spain truly had the power to stop the Philippines from progressing. Despite the oppression and decline brought by colonial rule, he remained hopeful for the country's future. He offered several reasons for this optimism:</p>

      title="Rizal's Forecast"
      content={
        <div className="historical-card">
          <p className="mb-4">In his essay, Rizal questioned whether the Philippines would remain a Spanish colony in the future. He acknowledged that Spain had maintained control for 300 years because Filipinos had been loyal, sacrificing their freedom due to the promises and friendship offered by Spain.</p>

          <p className="mb-4">Over time, however, Filipinos began to view the colonizers as exploiters rather than protectors. Rizal predicted that if this situation continued, the Filipino people would eventually rise up, leading to a revolution unless Spain reformed. He outlined two key demands from the Filipinos:</p>

          <div className="flex items-center gap-4 ml-6 mb-4">
            <div className="bg-accent text-white rounded-full w-8 h-8 flex items-center justify-center shrink-0">1</div>
            <p>Representation in the Spanish Cortes and the ability to address grievances.</p>

            <p>The right to human rights and freedoms.</p>
          </div>

          <p>Rizal suggested that fulfilling these demands would allow the Philippines to remain a colony but with more freedom and legal protections. However, if ignored, the Filipinos would seek independence. He clarified that his hope was for greater freedom, not complete separation, and advocated for peaceful negotiations with Spain to achieve this.</p>

                  <li>Originally written in Tagalog to ensure it could be widely read by Filipino women.</li>
                  <li>Praised the 20 young women of Malolos for their courage in demanding education despite opposition.</li>
                  <li>Advanced ideas about women's equality and education that were progressive for the time.</li>
                  <li>Highlighted the crucial role of women, especially mothers, in nation-building.</li>
                  <li>Challenged women to develop critical thinking and not blindly follow authority figures.</li>

                <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-4">Historical Context and Impact</h3>
                <p className="mb-4">The letter was a response to an incident in 1888 when twenty young women from Malolos, Bulacan, petitioned the Governor-General to allow them to open a night school where they could learn Spanish, despite opposition from the local parish priest. Their brave act caught the attention of Marcelo H. del Pilar, who asked Rizal to write them a letter of commendation.</p>
                <p className="mb-4">In the male-dominated society of 19th-century Philippines, Rizal's advocacy for women's education and recognition of their important role in society was revolutionary. The letter helped to inspire a generation of educated Filipino women who later played crucial roles in the nationalist movement.</p>
                <p>Today, the letter remains an important historical document in the development of feminism in the Philippines and continues to inspire discussions about gender equality, education, and women's roles in society.</p>

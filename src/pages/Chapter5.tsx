      content={
        <div className="historical-card">
          <p className="mb-4">In his essay, Rizal questioned whether the Philippines would remain a Spanish colony in the future. He acknowledged that Spain had maintained control for 300 years because Filipinos had been loyal, sacrificing their freedom due to the promises and friendship offered by Spain.</p>

          <p className="mb-4">Over time, however, Filipinos began to view the colonizers as exploiters rather than protectors. Rizal predicted that if this situation continued, the Filipino people would eventually rise up, leading to a revolution unless Spain reformed. He outlined two key demands from the Filipinos:</p>

          <div className="flex items-center gap-4 ml-6 mb-4">
            <div className="bg-accent text-white rounded-full w-8 h-8 flex items-center justify-center shrink-0">1</div>
            <p>Representation in the Spanish Cortes and the ability to address grievances.</p>

            <p>The right to human rights and freedoms.</p>
          </div>

          <p>Rizal suggested that fulfilling these demands would allow the Philippines to remain a colony but with more freedom and legal protections. However, if ignored, the Filipinos would seek independence. He clarified that his hope was for greater freedom, not complete separation, and advocated for peaceful negotiations with Spain to achieve this.</p>

                <p className="mb-4">The letter was a response to an incident in 1888 when twenty young women from Malolos, Bulacan, petitioned the Governor-General to allow them to open a night school where they could learn Spanish, despite opposition from the local parish priest. Their brave act caught the attention of Marcelo H. del Pilar, who asked Rizal to write them a letter of commendation.</p>
                <p className="mb-4">In the male-dominated society of 19th-century Philippines, Rizal's advocacy for women's education and recognition of their important role in society was revolutionary. The letter helped to inspire a generation of educated Filipino women who later played crucial roles in the nationalist movement.</p>
                <p>Today, the letter remains an important historical document in the development of feminism in the Philippines and continues to inspire discussions about gender equality, education, and women's roles in society.</p>

While Jose Rizal is often referred to as a national hero, this is only mentioned in the "whereas" clause of the 1956 Rizal Lawânot in its main provisions. In 1995, a government committee recommended nine individuals to be declared national heroes, but no formal action followed.</p>

                        <p>In 2014, Representative Rene Relampagos filed House Bill 3926, or the Philippine National Symbols Act of 2014, to officially recognize national symbols such as Jose Rizal as the only national hero, adobo as the national food, and the jeepney as the national vehicle.

                  <div className="historical-card mb-6">
                    <p className="mb-4">There has been debate about Dr. Jose Rizal's status as the Philippines' national hero, with some arguing he does not deserve the title. Critics point out that Rizal never led a revolution or engaged in armed resistance against colonial rule, unlike Andres Bonifacio and other Katipunan leaders. They believe a national hero should be someone who fought and died for the country's freedom, not just a reformist intellectual.</p>
                    
                    <p>Another argument against Dr. Jose Rizal's status as a national hero is that he was a "made-to-order" hero, promoted by the Americans, particularly by Governor Howard Taft. Critics claim that the American government strongly supported Rizal's recognition as the Philippines' national hero because he did not speak out against American colonization. Additionally, some argue that Rizal's writings, such as the "Letter to the Women of Malolos" and "Filipinas dentro de cien aÃ±os" (The Philippines Within a Century), suggested he had optimistic views on American rule, believing it would bring freedom and progress to the Philippines.</p>

Ocampo argued that while JosÃ© Rizal did not criticize the Americans, this does not mean he supported their colonial rule. Rizal did not speak out against American colonization because he had no direct knowledge of it, as he died before their control was fully established in the Philippines. Ocampo suggested that Rizal, a pragmatist, may have seen the Americans as potential allies in the fight against Spanish corruption and abuse, though he did not necessarily endorse their colonization.</p>
                        
                        <p>Furthermore, Ocampo emphasized that Rizal's heroism stemmed not just from his intellect or martyrdom, but from his life of excellence, integrity, and patriotism, envisioning the Philippines as a free and independent nation.</p>

He was a symbol of resistance against colonial oppression, and many Filipinos fought and died for their country because of his influence. Rizal's birth and death are remembered and recognized by the Filipino people. His name can be found in almost all aspects of Filipino life, from streets and buildings to schools and hospitals.</p>

The Propaganda Movement was a political and cultural campaign during the late 19th century that sought to reform the Spanish colonial government in the Philippines. Rizal was a towering figure in the Propaganda Movement, and he took an admirable part in that movement. His works, such as his essays and letters, were instrumental in promoting the cause of the Propaganda Movement.

Rizal was executed by the Spanish colonial government on December 30, 1896, for his involvement in the Philippine Revolution. His death inspired the Filipino people to continue the struggle for independence and freedom. Rizal's martyrdom became a symbol of the Filipino people's resistance against colonial oppression, and his name became synonymous with the struggle for national liberation.</p>

                      <p>While in Madrid, Rizal wrote to his mother assuring her of his faith in God. When his sister Olympia died, Rizal expressed his faith saying "I console myself saying that it was the will of God and what He does must be the best." Even as he and his family were persecuted by the Spanish friars, Rizal's belief in God never faltered.</p>

                  <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Criteria for becoming a National Hero</h3>
                  
                  <div className="historical-card mb-6">
                    <p className="mb-4">In 1900, the Philippine Commission passed Act No. 137, merging the districts of Morong and Manila to form the "Province of Rizal," named in honor of Dr. Jose Rizal. This marked the beginning of the formal recognition of heroes in the Philippines. Over time, heroes have been honored in various ways, including through speeches, holidays, street names, monuments, and more. As many names were celebrated as heroes, the need to evaluate the criteria for declaring a national hero arose.</p>
                    
                    <p className="mb-4">During his presidency, Ferdinand Marcos tasked the National Heroes Commission to establish such criteria. Later, under President Fidel V. Ramos, an executive order on March 28, 1993, created the National Heroes Committee (NHC), which was tasked with studying, evaluating, and recommending figures for national hero status. The committee, composed of distinguished members, developed new criteria after a series of discussions.</p>
                    
                    <p>On June 3, 1993, the National Heroes Committee, including members like Drs. Onofre D. Corpuz, Samuel K. Tan, and Ambeth Ocampo, adopted these criteria for national heroes:</p>
                    <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-1 mb-4">
                      <li>Heroes are those who aspire and fight for the nation's freedom.</li>
                      <li>Heroes contribute to a system of freedom and order.</li>
                      <li>Heroes enhance the quality of life and shape the nation's destiny.</li>
                    </ol>
                  </div>
                  
                  <div className="historical-card">
                    <p className="mb-4">Adopted by the Technical Committee of the National Heroes Committee on November 15, 1995, Manila:</p>
                    <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-1 mb-4">
                      <li>A hero is part of the people's expression.</li>
                      <li>A hero thinks of the future, especially the future generations.</li>
                      <li>The choice of a hero involves not only the recounting of an episode or events in history, but of the entire process that made this person a hero.</li>
                    </ol>
                    
                    <p>However, as discussed earlier, no law, executive order, or proclamation has been officially enacted or issued, proclaiming any Filipino historical figure as a national hero. Nevertheless, laws and directives were issued to honor some names because of their substantial roles in nation-building and contributions to history.</p>
